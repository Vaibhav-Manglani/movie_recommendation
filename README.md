# Movie Recommendation System
This is a project I made using the TMDB datasets. It has two types of recommendation systems. <br />
 - One is based on Bag of Words(BoW) method and recommends the 5 movies based on the user's input. <br />
 - The second system uses the average vote rating and the vote count, and thus applies a weighted average formula to determine the final rating of a movie, out of which, Top 20 are recommended to the users. <br />

## How to deploy this on your machine : 
1. Download the files and the datasets.
2. Run both the iPython files on Jupyter and export the 3 pickle files.
3. Open app.py on your PyCharm IDE and import the mentioned libraries.
4. Type `streamlit run app.py` in your terminal.
5. The project opens on your browser.
